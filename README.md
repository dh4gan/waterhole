# The Galactic/Terrestrial Microwave Windows ("The Water Hole")

This repository computes the brightness temperature received at radio telescopes due to a variety of environmental and noise factors.  These contributions are highly relevant for those attempting to Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI).

The Jupyter notebook enclosed computes contributions from:

 1. Synchrotron emission from the Galaxy
 2. The shot noise limit
 3. The cosmic microwave background
 4. Absorption by the Earth's atmosphere

Earth's atmospheric absorption data was pre-computed using the Planetary Spectrum Generator (assuming Mauna Kea conditions).
