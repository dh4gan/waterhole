This repository computes the galactic and terrestrial microwave windows, relevant for the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI).

The microwave window is defined by:

i) Synchrotron emission from the Galaxy
ii) The shot noise limit
iii) The cosmic microwave background
iv) Absorption by the Earth's atmosphere

The Jupyter notebook enclosed computes all four effects.  Earth's atmospheric absorption data was computed using the Planetary Spectrum Generator (assuming Mauna Kea conditions).
